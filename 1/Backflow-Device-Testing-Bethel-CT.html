Please trim your plants and arrange for testing with a company from our certified tester list This should be finished within 30 days to avoid water service disruption.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not happen it could also show softener breakdown, or a problem with the salt that is used. In the house shops, the majority of Badger 5 disposals can be purchased for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's extra service warranty, with installation, clients are taking a look at around $325.
