<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic ways of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.
