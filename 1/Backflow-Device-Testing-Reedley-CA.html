<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
