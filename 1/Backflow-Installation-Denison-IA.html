The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
