<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as detailed below. Both will create a good seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more fragile and prone to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and pressures as a result of temperature level change and ice formation. And these differences determine the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
