<p>Find the best water softener for you. One typical way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread exponentially.
