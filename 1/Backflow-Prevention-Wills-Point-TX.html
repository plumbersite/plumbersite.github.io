<p>When compared to gas designs, electric models are simpler and less expensive to install as electrical power is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated correctly using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electric models, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is especially real if you have without treatment tough water, which consists of severe minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is challenging to repair. Leakages often indicate a new system replacement is in order.</p>
