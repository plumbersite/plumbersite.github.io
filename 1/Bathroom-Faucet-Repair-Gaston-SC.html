As a result, the softening tanks have to be cleaned much more routinely, when rock salt is used. Rock salt is more affordable than vaporized salt and solar salt, however tank cleaning might use up a great deal of your energy and time.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>
