<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I discover that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Due to the fact that they don't like the technology and not because it does not work, will also say something does not work well simply.

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
