Many people discard food waste in the trash, which indicates more garbage to go in landfills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's frequently foul-smelling and commonly utilizes plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in garbage dumps instead of breaking down.</p>
<p>Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they might also require a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing generally requires an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.
