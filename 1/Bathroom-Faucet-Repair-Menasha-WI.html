<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust areas, and use less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are appropriate for washing devices, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for a provided application and which are worn or broken and need replacement must be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the offered application.

No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more often than you believe! When you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems.
