<p>Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant gotten here during the designated time period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and suggested a tool to be utilized in the future. How do you know if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Look out for several clogged drains in your home, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water discolorations on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
