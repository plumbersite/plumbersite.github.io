<p>Regrettably, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
