For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
