<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the very same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, with time, it still does corrode. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
