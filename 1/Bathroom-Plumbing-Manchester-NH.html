<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your daily regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible undamaged.</p>
