When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the potable water supply.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals discovered in water. Normally, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water till it is in your house.

The fundamental methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow.
