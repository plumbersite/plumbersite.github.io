<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages. We find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
