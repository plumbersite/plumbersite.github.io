<h3>Replace Faucet in Devine Texas</h2>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets.

Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
