<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health threat or health risk conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
