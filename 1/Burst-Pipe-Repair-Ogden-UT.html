Regular obstructions, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could suggest a problem with the disposal. If there are leakages originating from your system, it is most likely due to excessive usage over an extended period of time. A number of these leakages can be fixed, however if they become larger and more regular, you need to consider overall system replacement.</p>
