<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can produce sound. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling tough water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its brand-new place and placed there.</p>
