Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process utilized to clear particles from the side gutter pipes on your home.</p>
<p>Inspect to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog.

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.
