These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most common signs that your system is at completion of its life expectancy, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and merely needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
