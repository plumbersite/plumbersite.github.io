<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
