When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
