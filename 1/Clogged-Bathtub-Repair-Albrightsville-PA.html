<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
