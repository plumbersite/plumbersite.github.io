<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
