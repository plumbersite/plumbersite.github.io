<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
