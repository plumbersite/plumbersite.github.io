<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Silverthorne CO</h3>
<p>Is your water smelly or bad tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you wish to consume? A water purification system with chiller will provide you with cool, clean, delicious water for every glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we understand the satisfaction of a gratifying beverage of water. So, we concentrate on installation, repair and service of water purification systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
