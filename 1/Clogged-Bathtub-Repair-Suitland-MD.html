<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers need to be able to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside.
