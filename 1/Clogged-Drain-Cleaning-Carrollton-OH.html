Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust spots, and utilize less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are suitable for washing makers, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
