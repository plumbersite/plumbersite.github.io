<h3>Gas Line Replacement in Lake City South Carolina</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
