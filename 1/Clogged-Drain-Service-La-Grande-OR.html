<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
