<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
