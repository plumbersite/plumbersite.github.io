<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
