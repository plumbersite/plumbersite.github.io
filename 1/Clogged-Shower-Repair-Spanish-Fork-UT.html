<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is happy to utilize Bio-Clean items for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural solution that's both harmless to your plumbing and incredibly reliable at getting rid of gunk, waste, and natural material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out organic product and eat away at it, developing safe by-products of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
