<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical designs are simpler and less costly to install as electrical energy is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated effectively using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electrical designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
