<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In cold climates, water, waste or soil pipes should not be set up beyond a house, in outside walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other location subjected to freezing temperature unless some arrangements are made to safeguard it from freezing by insulation or heat. Many brand-new houses include contemporary cooking areas-- stainless steel devices, energy-efficient stovetops and ranges, and garbage disposals. Nevertheless, most houses more than 20 years of age do not have a waste disposal unit in their kitchen sink.</p>
