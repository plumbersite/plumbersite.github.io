<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>These branching distribution pipelines form loops and networks including water pipe and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines provide water for entire communities in addition to big commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending upon the flow capability, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter reinforced concrete.</p>

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain. The majority of drains are attached to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
