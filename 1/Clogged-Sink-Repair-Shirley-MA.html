<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
