<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken appliance is frustrating to handle, the good news is that installing a replacement disposal will be less expensive than installing a brand-new garbage disposal in a sink that has never ever had one before. Depending on the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
