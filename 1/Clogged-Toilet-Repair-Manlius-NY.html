These flanges are easy and commonly offered to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water supply to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing during the installation process, turned off the water system to your house. Ensure your water heater's supply of water is turned off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
