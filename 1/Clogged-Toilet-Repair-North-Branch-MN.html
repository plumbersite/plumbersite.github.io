<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our stiff trust certification standards. A great general rule is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs difficult and costly, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
