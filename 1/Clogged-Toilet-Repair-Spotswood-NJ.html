Your home is over ten years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines inspected. Some plumbers might get professional discount rates from retailers or kitchen and bath display rooms.

You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
