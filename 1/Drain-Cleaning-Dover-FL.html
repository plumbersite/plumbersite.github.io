<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
