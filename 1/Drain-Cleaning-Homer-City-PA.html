Bio-Clean is a natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at eliminating gunk, waste, and natural material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a service of live germs that actively look for natural material and gnaw at it, creating safe byproducts of carbon dioxide, mineral, and water ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI.

The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
