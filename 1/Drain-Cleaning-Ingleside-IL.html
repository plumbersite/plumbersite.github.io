<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
