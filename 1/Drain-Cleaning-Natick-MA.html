In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Commercial structures with pitch roofings might likewise need roofing system drain cleaning. Their roofing system seamless gutters are generally connected to 4-inch diameter vertical roofing drain pipes, which in turn, link to 4-inch diameter underground horizontal pipes that stream into local storm drains just below street level.
