<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it might wreak unwelcome concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Building regulations can differ from city to city, however all serve the very same function.
