<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical enough that many people choose do-it-yourself repairs. However in some cases even determining the leak can be an issue. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal fixes all of those problems, adding benefit. Merely switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and much more quietly than you believe. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals don't really utilize blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are easily removed and became strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to reduce the total costs of treatment.</p>
<p>It's an oddly intricate clinical process, but easy to correct. It uses salt to eliminate odors and minerals discovered in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
