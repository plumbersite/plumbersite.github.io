One common way for a home's water system to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
