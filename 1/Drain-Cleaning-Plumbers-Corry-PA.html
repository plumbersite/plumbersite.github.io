Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
