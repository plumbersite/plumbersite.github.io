<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Fort Walton Beach FL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
