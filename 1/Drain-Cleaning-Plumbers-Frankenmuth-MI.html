<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and responsibility are incredibly essential to constructing a credibility for quality. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall. If it isn't, you'll need to either select a smaller disposer, or modify the plumbing to accommodate the brand-new setup. Nasty odors. A practical sewer line must always be sealed airtight, suggesting no water or gas should ever leak out. If however, you start smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around the house, there might be a fracture somewhere in your sewer line.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.
