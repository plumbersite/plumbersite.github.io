<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
