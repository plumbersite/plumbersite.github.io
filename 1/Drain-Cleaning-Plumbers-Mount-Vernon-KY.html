<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Mount Vernon KY 40456</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
