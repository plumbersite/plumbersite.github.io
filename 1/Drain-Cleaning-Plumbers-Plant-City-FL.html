<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Plant City FL</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of house owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
