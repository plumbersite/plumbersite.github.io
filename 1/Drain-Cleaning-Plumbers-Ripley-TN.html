<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
