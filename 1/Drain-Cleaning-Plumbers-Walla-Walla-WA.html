It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of effectively.
