<p>Leaks are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
