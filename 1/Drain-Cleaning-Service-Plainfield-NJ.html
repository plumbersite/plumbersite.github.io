Having a plumbing inspection is pretty basic when buying a home or flat. , if it's a leasing I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.. Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most expensive repair jobs if overlooked.
