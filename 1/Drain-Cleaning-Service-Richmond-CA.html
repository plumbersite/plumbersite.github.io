<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
