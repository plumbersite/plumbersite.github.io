<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you've discovered the trip lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.

The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
