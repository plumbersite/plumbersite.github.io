<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure.

The pipelines supply water for entire communities in addition to big commercial, residential and industrial complexes. Depending upon the circulation capacity, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent.

Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
