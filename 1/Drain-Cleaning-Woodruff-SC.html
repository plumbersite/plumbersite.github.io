<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
