<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its normal flow. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system differ "regular," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water going into the potable water circulation system.</p>
