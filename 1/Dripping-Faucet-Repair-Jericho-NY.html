<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some clogs.
