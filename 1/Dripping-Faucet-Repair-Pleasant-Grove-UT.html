<p>Roto-Rooter has actually remained in the drain cleaning service since 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the first electrical drain cleaning machine and founded the very first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the technology hasn't altered much from Blanc's classic invention, and uses blades to cut through particles to restore appropriate water circulation.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only eliminate as much building product as necessary to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
