<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Santa Clarita CA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
