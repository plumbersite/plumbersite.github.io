<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
