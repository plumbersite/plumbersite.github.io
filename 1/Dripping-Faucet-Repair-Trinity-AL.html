<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011.
