Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these issues, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these issues can be credited to typical wear and tear or incorrect installation, often your garbage disposal ends up being harmed by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>

If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms in your household, make an appointment to have a plumber diagnose the issue. The sooner you fix plumbing problems, the more economical the repairs. Given that there is no tank in this kind of heater, you also get to maximize some space in your house as it supplies on-demand warm water. Also, holding tanks have other problems such as rust and rust that eventually causes tank failure. There is no such issue with our tankless heater.</p>

Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up.
