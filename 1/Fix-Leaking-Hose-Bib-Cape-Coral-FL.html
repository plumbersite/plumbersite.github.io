<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense.
