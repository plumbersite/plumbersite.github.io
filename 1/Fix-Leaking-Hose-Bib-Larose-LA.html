<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.
