<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
