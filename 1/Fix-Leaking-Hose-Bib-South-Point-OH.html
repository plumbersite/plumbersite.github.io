Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your hot water heater really quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a quick fix in the short term, it can cause far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent place to start trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is beneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the moisture most.</p>
