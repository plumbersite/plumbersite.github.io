Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive.
