Backflow prevention gadgets operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a structure or component.

For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream backwards into the safe and clean water system.

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
