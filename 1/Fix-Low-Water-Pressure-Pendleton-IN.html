The LADBS application need to be submitted and spent for at least two (2) business days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have actually acquired all other required approvals or clearances from all other companies. Waste disposal unit can be made from either aluminum or stainless-steel. Aluminum is more economical but more prone to leaking and deterioration. Stainless-steel blades are also more durable.
