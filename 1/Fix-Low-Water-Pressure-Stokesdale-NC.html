<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes broken or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
