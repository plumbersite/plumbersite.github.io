For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement may flow in reverse into the safe and clean water system. To safeguard water quality, backflow security is required where the end user postures a risk of polluting the city's supply of water.</p>
