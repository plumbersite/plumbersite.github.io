<p>Once you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
