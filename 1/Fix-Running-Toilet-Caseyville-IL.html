<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>We specialize in entire home re-pipes, brand-new plumbing installations, and mainline water service replacement.

<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 various events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, as with everyone we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and really experienced. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
