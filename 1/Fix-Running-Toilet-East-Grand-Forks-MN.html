<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
