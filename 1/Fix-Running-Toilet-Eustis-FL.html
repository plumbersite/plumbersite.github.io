<p>Once a large adequate source of water has been identified and assessed, the 3rd significant element of a supply of water system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
