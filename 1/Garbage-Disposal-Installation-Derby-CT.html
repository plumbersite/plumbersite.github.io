<p>Installed under the sink, the waste disposal unit is implied for slicing up smidgens of waste food.

You need to constantly run water while utilizing the garbage disposal; when the waste disposal unit does its job, the water flushes the finely chopped particles down the drain.</p>

To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
