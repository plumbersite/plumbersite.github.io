Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
