<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
