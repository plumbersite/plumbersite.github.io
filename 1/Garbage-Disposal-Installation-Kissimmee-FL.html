<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
