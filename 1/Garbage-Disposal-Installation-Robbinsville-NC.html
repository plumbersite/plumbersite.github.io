<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
