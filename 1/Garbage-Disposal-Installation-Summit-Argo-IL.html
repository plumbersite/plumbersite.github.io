<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common types of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today. Among the reasons it's so popular is the cost, and it's known to stand up to high temperatures. It is often used for hot water piping and drain pipes. Foul smell: A strong, undesirable smell coming from your drains might indicate one of 2 problems: food clogging up the drain, or a bigger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain.
