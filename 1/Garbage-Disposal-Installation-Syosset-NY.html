<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
