If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the number of bathrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last costs.</p>
