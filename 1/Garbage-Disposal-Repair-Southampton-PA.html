<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more fragile and prone to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure.
