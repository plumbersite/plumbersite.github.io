<p>If you observe an odor or undesirable smell coming from your unit, which is not unusual, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave. These flanges are easy and widely readily available to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware shops. Shut off the water system to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, shut off the supply of water to your home. Make certain your hot water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electricity going to the unit.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
