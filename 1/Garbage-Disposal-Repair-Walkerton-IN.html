Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>
