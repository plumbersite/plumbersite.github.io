<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Lindon UT</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
