<p>When Bill Howe supplies the disposal and sets up for installation, consumers receive a full one-year parts and labor warranty. What that means for consumers is that if the disposal fails for any reason, we will return out at no charge and install a brand-new disposal. Customers should also register the disposal to take advantage of the producer warranty duration.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
