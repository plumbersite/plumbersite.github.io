<p>We specialize in storm drain inspections and cleaning. Most kitchen sink blockages are due to heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and use the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can depend on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and enjoy better water for bathing and devices.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a quick fix in the short term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent location to start searching for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is beneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the dampness most.</p>

Kenny came out and did an incredible task unclogging my storm drain. He detected the issue and was able to come back and jet it out.
