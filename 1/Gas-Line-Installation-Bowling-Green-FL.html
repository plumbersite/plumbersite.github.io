<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Bowling Green FL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If a natural gas line is damaged when digging beyond the house, call your local gas utility company instantly. Remove the drain basket and surround the sink hole with a coil of plumber. Most plumbers are qualified to install disposals, but if a GFCI outlet is required, an electrical contractor might also be required. When you are prepared for a plumbing inspection, please contact your Plumbing Inspector noted on your authorization. You may also see the Plumbing Inspector Area Map link for the inspector in your area or call 651-266-8989. Plumbing Inspectors are readily available from 7:30 am - 9:00 am Monday through Friday.</p>
