<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Bowling Green MO</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>It's essential to be mindful that a lot of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is caused by tough water if your issue is more related to scale and mineral accumulation. Tough water usually leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become quite unpleasant. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will definitely help, we highly suggest you check out setting up a water softener to assist with your hard water.</p>
