<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
