<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>This short article intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive.

For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, best? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
