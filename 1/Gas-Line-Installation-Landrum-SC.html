It might a couple of weeks to totally repipe your entire home if you have a huge house and don't work with adequate contractors. If you live in a cold-weather environment, we highly suggest repiping your house during spring or summertime so you don't have to fret about freezing temperature levels during the repiping procedure.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions.
