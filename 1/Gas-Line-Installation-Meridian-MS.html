A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Check to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you may need to flip the switch discovered on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink.</p>
