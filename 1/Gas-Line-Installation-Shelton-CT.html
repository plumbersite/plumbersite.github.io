<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
