<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Wildwood FL 34785</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

Leaks often mean a new system replacement remains in order.</p>
