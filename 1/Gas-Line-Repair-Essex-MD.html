When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
