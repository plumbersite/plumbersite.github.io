<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
