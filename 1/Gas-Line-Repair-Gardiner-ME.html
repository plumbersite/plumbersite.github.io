<p>Circulation pipes shift to even smaller private service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, house shops, businesses and buildings.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
