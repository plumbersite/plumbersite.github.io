<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Kingsland GA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is a fairly affordable plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your warm water heater. Fill the sink with water and touch a facial tissue in between the bottom of the kitchen sink drain and the sink. If the tissue picks up any water, you've got a leaky basket strainer and it's time to find out how to remove a sink drain.
