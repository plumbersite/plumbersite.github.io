<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide.

If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.
