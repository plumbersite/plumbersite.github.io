<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from corrosion and may position toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your home.
