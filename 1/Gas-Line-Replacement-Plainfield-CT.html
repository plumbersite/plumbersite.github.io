<p>As an entrepreneur, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating result on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential sewage systems and are more vulnerable to blockages and obstruction. All backflow preventers need to be tested each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to us.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Due to the fact that copper is revealing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
