<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Youngsville NC</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
