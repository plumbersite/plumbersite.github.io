<p>Backflow preventers are likewise needed by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).

When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on dry or damp lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
