Unscrew the cover from the disposer's electrical compartment.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is connected to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
