Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts the use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all required inspections. We hope this list is useful to you throughout the course of your task. Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection.
