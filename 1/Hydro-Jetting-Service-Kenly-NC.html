<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and particles.
