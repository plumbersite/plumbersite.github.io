<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will generally recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the intensity of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The last thing you want is for your garbage disposal to give out if you invest time entertaining visitors and cooking.
