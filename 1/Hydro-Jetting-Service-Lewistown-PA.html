Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in location to secure our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing reminder notification thirty days prior to the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- essentially 2 layers of protection. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering the structure, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong method.
