<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
