<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure correct backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water during the irrigation season.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
