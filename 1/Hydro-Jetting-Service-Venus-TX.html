It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly.
