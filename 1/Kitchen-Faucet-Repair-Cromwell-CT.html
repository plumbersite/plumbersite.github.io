<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Cromwell CT</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your home? Water pressure in the home resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is MUCH more cost-effective than mold remediation or changing floor covering or drywall! So we advise fixing or installing water pressure regulators to protect your entire house.</p>
