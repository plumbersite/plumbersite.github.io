<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
