<p>Commercial structures with pitch roofings may also require roofing system drain cleaning. Their roofing system gutters are generally linked to 4-inch size vertical roofing drain pipes, which in turn, connect to 4-inch size underground horizontal pipes that flow into municipal storm drains simply listed below street level. Roto-Rooter has the experience and mechanical ability to totally clean such commercial roofing drains to bring back complete drainage to the system.</p>
