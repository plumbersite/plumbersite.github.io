<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Hopkinsville KY 42240</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
