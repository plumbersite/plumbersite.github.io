<p>Find the right water softener for you. One typical method for a home's water system to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread greatly. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- essentially 2 layers of protection. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically defined-- a reduced pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I mention them just.</p>
