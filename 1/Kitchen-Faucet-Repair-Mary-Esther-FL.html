<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Tank to Tankless installation: If you're switching from a water tank to a tankless design, the installation procedure takes a bit longer. Extra time is needed to install brand-new power and water lines and air vents. Afterward, the tankless unit needs to also be mounted and connected. This sewer line repair option involves utilizing traditional repair methods, more typically referred to as trench repair techniques. When this method of sewer line repair is used, our professionals will need to get to the repair area by digging a trench. The digging of this trench can be done by hand or by using a backhoe.</p>
