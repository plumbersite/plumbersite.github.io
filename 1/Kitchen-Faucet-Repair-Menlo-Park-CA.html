<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Menlo Park CA</h3>
<p>Is your water bad or foul-smelling tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you wish to drink? A water purification system with chiller will provide you with cool, clean, delicious water for every single glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we understand the satisfaction of a rewarding drink of water. So, we concentrate on installation, repair and service of water purification systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
