A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Morehead City NC</h3>
<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
