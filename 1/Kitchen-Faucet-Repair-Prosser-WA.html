<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
