WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
