<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
