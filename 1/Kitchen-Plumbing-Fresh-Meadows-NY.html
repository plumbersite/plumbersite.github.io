<p>Most importantly, never plant anything up versus your home, in front of windows, nor close to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your home to the city line.) If you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not know, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line.
