If you notice that your plumbing struggles with various obstructions, leaks, and water pressure fluctuation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. House owners should check water pressure entering their home on a routine basis. Water pressure ought to have to do with 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
