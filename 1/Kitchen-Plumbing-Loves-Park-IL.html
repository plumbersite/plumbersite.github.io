<p>As soon as a big adequate source of water has been identified and examined, the 3rd major part of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
