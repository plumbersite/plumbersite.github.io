The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
