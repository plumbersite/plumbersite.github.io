<p>The program accomplishes its mission by attending to the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and regulations for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated.

There are a couple of things you need to know if you are on the fence about purchasing one.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Is your drain clogged with hair, particles, or toilet paper? After years of use, drains can collect damaging accumulation. This accumulation obstructs water flow, eventually supporting your drains till they are unusable. Typically, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing.
