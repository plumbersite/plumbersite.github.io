<p>Many need for plumbers will originate from new building and the need to repair and keep plumbing systems in existing residences and other structures.

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. The majority of drains are attached to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
