Fair point. But water softeners were created to fight a remarkably typical problem: difficult water.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
