Howard, the Project Manager, has always been helpful and informative relating to all our issues. He did the proposition and scheduled the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always an enjoyment to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again crucial for the repair professional to be familiar with the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale growth or deterioration.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
