Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
