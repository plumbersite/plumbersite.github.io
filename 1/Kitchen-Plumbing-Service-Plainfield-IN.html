<p>We're replacing a natural gas water heater in our presentation. The actions for replacing a gas hot water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are similar.

<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Plainfield IN 46168</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
