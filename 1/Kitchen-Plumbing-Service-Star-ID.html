<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Star ID</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If permitted to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
