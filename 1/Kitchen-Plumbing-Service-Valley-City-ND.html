Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be one of the most expensive repair jobs if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a problem, you may need all of your water piping changed. Again, really costly.

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
