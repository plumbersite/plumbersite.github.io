<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from deterioration and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house.
