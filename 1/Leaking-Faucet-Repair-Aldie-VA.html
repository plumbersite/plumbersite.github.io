<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be offered.</p>
