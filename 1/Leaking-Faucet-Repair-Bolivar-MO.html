Softened water (determined as residual sodium carbonate index) in which calcium and magnesium have been partially replaced by salt is not appropriate for irrigation use, as it tends to cause the development of alkali soils 18 Non-chemical gadgets are often used in place of conventional water softening for this application.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
