<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Culver City CA</h3>
<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
