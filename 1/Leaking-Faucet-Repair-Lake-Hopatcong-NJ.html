<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Lake Hopatcong NJ 07849?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
