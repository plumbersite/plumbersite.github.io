<p>Find the best water softener for you. One typical way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out significantly if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>

You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
