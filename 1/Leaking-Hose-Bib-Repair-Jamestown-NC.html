<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from rust and might position toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your home. This may not need totally repiping the house, because more recent materials may have currently been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
