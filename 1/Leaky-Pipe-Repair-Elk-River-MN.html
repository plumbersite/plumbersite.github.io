<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, must be fulfilled by an effectively sized supply of water, which constitutes the second major part of a water system system.

<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake.
