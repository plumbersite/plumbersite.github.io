<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the water system to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs lots of products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation should be examined to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be collected to figure out the functions of each component. The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was properly repaired.

A correctly fixed assembly should supply years of defense.</p>
