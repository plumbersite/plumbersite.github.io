<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were fantastic. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess.

Don't depend on a plunger to correct the problem-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair.

A lot of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
