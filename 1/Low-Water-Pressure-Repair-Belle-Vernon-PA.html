<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
