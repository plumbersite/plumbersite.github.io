<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
