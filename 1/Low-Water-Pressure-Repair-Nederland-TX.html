<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
