<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Old Orchard Beach ME</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. Since of the tight space, the pipes often make weird gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, leading to the weird noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the support of a professional. Some small clogs can be looked after with a plunger and often, when the toilet won't stop running, it's an easy matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank.
