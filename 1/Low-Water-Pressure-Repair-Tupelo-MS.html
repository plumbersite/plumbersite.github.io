<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and might position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your home.
