<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
