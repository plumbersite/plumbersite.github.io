<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Fort Wayne IN 46835?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
