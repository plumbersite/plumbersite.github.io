Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
