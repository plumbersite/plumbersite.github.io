<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system.

It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
