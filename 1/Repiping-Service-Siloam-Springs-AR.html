<p>Instead of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter technicians will drill just a couple of holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it rapidly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your house or company. The other difference in between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (thus the name)-- not simultaneously like a constant feed garbage disposal.</p>
