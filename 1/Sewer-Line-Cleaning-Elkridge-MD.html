<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
