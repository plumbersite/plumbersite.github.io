It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
