Typically, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers tough water.</p>
