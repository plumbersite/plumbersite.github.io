<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Florence KY 41042</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
