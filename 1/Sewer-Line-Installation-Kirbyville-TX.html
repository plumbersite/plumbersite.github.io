<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
