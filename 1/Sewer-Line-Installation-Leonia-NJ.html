Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
