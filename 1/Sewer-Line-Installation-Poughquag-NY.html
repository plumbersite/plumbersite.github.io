<p>As soon as you have actually found the trip lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the trip lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
