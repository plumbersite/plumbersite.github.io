<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>
