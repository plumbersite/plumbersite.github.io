<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<p>This is another mix that can deal with sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the very first time, you can duplicate this procedure.
