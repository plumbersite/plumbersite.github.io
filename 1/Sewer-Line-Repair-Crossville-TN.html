<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, a special type of black pipe need to be used that is coated with an unique plastic product that keeps the wetness out.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
