When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
