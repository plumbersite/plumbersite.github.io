<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe should be utilized that is coated with a special plastic product that keeps the moisture out.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
