<p>In water supply systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Given that a tankless heater does not have any tank and heats the water on the go, it is very convenient. When you need it and are capable of bringing water up to steaming and relaxing temperature level in just seconds, these heaters heat up the water as and.

<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
