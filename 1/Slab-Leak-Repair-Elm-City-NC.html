<p>Sinkholes do not just occur in your yard, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your house's structure. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out beneath your home, a sinkhole will cause the foundation to shift and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need expert plumbers along with structure repair specialists.</p>

This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
