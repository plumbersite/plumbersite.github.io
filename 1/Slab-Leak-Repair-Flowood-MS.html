<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>The California Code of Laws, Title 17, mandates water purveyors, such as EBMUD, to administer a cross-connection control prevention program, which helps keep drinkable water from pollutant and contaminant direct exposure.
