<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, but simple to fix. It utilizes salt to remove odors and minerals discovered in difficult water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and attract sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
