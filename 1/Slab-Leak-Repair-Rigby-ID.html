<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are harmless, but with time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
