<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide.

If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.
