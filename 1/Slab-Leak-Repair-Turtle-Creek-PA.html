The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet).

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
