I recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was just 6 years old. Conventional hot water heater with a tank should typically last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has actually not been used in more than two years. Washing meals is my least favorite task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
