<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, gradually, it still does corrode. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is incredibly difficult, all the inbound water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry connections most likely need to be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In some cases, you might want to soften the hot water only. Measure the water usage at the designated connections for each individual in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
