<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Central SC</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who handle basic repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating jobs and additions.</p>
