<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
