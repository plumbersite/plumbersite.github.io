Harder products, like eggshells and fish bones, search the disposal walls and assist keep them clean too.

Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
