<p>Difficult water reduces the life-span of many significant devices and systems in your home due to the amount of limescale and sediment buildup that happens. Limescale on pipes can cause deterioration and obstructions, which not just shortens the life-span of the pipes but puts you in a position where you may have to spend for an expensive repair. Accumulation in pipes can likewise result in a boost of water pressure, which can damage the whole sewer system and greatly increase the chances of a pipe bursting due to tension.</p>
