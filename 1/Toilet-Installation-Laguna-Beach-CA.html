<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Bad Smells - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not appropriately draining pipes water. Undesirable stinks are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this accumulation builds up, it can cause stronger smells, and more extreme piping problems. Without functional draining pipes, extreme pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak leading to pricey water damage.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
