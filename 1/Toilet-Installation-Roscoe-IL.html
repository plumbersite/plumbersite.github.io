<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage should also be provided.</p>
