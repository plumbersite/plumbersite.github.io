<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
