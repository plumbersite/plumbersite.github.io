<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any variety of elements which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force exerted by the expansion occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
