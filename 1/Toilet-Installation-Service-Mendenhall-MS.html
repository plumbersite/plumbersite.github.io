<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>If additional restorations are wanted, such as installing a tankless water heater or broadening the water system to accommodate a remodel, this is when those extra modifications will be made.
