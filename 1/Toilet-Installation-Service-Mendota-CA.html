Generally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>

They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the original structure material as possible undamaged.</p>
