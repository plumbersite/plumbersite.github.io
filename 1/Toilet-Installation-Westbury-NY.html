<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part.

If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
