<p>Eliminate electrical cover plate and remove the disposal from the electrical connections. Rock salt contains a lot of matter that is not water-soluble.

<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, as with each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and really knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or big job plumbing work.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
