<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we may use a variety of different methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire connectors. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Applications vary from softening in remote places to attending to issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given up horsepower, or HP. These correspond directly to just how much waste the unit can deal with, and suggested sizes are typically based on how many users are in a household. If your existing disposal obstructions frequently, is loud, leakages or does not operate properly, it might be time for a replacement. Installations must only be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
