<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our stiff trust accreditation standards. A good general rule is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and corroded parts make repairs expensive and difficult, indicating a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
