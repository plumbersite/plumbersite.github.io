<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Salt Lake City UT</h3>
<p>A newly set up hot water heater should not produce odd sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to warm the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
