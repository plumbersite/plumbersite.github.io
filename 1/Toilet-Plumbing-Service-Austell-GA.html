<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you turn on your home's water spigots and water starts flowing out with a yellow-colored, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has built up in your pipes and a repiping job must be in your future. State and local laws might impact the services this independently owned and run franchise place might perform at this time. Please contact the franchise location for extra information.</p>
