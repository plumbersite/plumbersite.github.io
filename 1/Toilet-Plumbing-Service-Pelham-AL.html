<p>A leaky garbage disposal can be repaired if you can locate the part that's causing the issue. Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners exchange the mineral ions of calcium and magnesium with sodium or potassium. By reducing the mineral material, the system avoids scaling. The exchanged ions are then flushed out of your drain. Toilet service, like toilet repair, is something that everyone tends to put off till it is an emergency.
