<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
