<p>A newly set up water heater should not produce strange sounds, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
