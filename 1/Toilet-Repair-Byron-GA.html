<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur regularly than you think! Often it takes place during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
