However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur regularly than you think! Often it takes place during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe.
