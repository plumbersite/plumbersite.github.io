<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc finish.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
