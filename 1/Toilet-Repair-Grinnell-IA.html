<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
