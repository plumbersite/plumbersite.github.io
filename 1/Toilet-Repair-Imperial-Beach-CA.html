<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Imperial Beach CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
