It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) as soon as you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank.

Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way.
