    <meta name="description" content="24 Hours Plumber Service Coweta Oklahoma - Trying to extend the pipe while you're working overhead in a tight space is both time-consuming and physically challenging, so it's often quicker (and simpler) just to cut out the entire drain trap and replace it. To install another weld-type drain, such as this 2-Inch Sioux Chief PVC Drain (available at SupplyHouse ), you'll want to assemble and dry fit all the connections before you glue them together.">

<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, particularly if that water is hot, the inside of your unit is most likely rusty. You will likely have to replace your hot water heater if it only occurs with hot water. You most likely do not know what type of pipes you have if you're like most house owners. A plumber from 1st Choice Plumbing can tell you for sure, however in general, there are 3 main types of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
