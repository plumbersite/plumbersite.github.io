Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain.

I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
