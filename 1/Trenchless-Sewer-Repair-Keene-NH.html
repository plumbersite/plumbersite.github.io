Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or improper installation, often your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by products that should not be run through it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
