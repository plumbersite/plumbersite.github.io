For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow backwards into the potable water supply.

Whole-house designs are proper for washing machines, or you can try laundry additive water softening items.</p>
