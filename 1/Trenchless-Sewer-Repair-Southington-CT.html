<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is developed to attract corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from wearing away. The very best method to avoid drain clogs is to view what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, small indentations or rust, your pipes are corroding. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and should be replaced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If the water heater leakages or burst, high water pressure also leads to thermal expansion in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage.

Replacing the pipes for numerous plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain.

When this method of sewer line repair is used, our professionals will need to access to the repair area by digging a trench. The digging of this trench can be done manually or by using a backhoe.</p>
