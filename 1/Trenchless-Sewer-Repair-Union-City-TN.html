<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
