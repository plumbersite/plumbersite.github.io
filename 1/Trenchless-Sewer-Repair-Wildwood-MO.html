<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such possible health threats are alarming, however they aren't the only issue. Backflow can also be exceptionally expensive to remediate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) specifies that the typical backflow event takes almost 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever questioned what exactly is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. But water softeners were produced to combat a remarkably typical problem: tough water.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
