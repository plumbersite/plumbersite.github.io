<p>When a big adequate source of water has actually been recognized and examined, the third major component of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
