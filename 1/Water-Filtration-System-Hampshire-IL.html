<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Hampshire IL 60140</h3>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
