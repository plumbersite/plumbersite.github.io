<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and harden or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
