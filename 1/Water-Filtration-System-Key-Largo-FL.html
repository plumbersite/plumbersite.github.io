<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads.
