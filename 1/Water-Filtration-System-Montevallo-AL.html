<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater.
