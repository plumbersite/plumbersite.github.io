<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires numerous products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation needs to be evaluated to ensure it does not circumvent the operations of the assembly. Test information should be built up to determine the operations of each element.

The backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated once again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test arises from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is essential to guarantee it was repaired effectively.
