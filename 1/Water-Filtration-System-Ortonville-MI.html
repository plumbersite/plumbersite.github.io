<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can literally eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer.

Without constant testing and servicing, these systems can allow infected water to flow freely within your supply pipes, producing a severe health threat to building residents. Each backflow prevention system requires different testing treatments and intervals, and demands significant experience and knowledge.</p>
