<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by a sufficiently sized supply of water, which makes up the 2nd major part of a water system system. With appropriate tank capability to fulfill variable peak load need, the water system source can offer a constant circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water flow can be utilized to refill storage towers, cisterns and tanks, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when need surpasses the standard pumping rate. A water system source can take many forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
