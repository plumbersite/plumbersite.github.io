<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Repiping is just installing all new incoming water lines to replace an old failing system. Many people repipe due to the fact that they have actually repeated leakages in their galvanized pipes, slab leaks from copper pipes in the concrete floor or leaks that have triggered damage to their house.
