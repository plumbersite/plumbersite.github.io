<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Chicago IL</h3>
<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a good balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently.

<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with many homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
