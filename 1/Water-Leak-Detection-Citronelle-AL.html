<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out.
