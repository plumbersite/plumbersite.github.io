<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
