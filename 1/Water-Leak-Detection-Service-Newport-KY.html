Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
