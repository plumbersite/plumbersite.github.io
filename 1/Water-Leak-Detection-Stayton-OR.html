<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
