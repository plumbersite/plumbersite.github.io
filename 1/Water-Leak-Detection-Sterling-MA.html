<p>When a large adequate source of water has actually been recognized and examined, the 3rd major part of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most large cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be shown on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and then each year.</p>
