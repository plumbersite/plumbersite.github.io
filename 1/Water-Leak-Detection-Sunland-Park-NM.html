<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow.

The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
