<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Williamsport PA 17701?</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in great shape.</p>
