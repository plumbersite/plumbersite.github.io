They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
