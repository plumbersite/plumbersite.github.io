<p>In water system systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>If the sink is no longer draining pipes as quickly as it once did, there's a good chance it's due to the fact that the waste disposal unit is clogged.
