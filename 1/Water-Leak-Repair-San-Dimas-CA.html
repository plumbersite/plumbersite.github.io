<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
