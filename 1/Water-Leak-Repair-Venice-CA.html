This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
