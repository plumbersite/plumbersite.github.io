<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Clarence NY</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>
