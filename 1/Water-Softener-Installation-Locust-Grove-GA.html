<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
