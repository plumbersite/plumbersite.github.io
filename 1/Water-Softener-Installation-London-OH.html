<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
