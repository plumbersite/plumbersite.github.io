<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>This article aims to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated facts that often lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
