<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
