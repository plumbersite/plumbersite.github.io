<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. It is essential that just original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
