These flanges are simple and widely readily available to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the water system to your house at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing throughout the installation process, shut off the water supply to your home. Ensure your water heater's water supply is shut off, as is the electrical energy going to the system.</p>
