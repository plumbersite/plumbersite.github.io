<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's potable water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for polluted water getting in the drinkable water circulation system.</p>

For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to likewise be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
