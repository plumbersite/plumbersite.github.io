<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that may require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that might require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your company, they can trigger financial losses and in some instances can stop your organisation entirely.

Even in a small workplace the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can cause significant issues.</p>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, sink, or shower) can be treated easily if the clog is easy and shallow. For many obstructions you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't resolve the issue then you may also have to employ a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
