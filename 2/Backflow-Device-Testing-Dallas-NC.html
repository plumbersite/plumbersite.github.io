<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical solution, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
