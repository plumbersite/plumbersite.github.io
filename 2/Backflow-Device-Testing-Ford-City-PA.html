<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Ford City PA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
