When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
