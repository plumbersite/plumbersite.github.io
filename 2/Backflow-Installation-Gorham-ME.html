<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Gorham ME</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make certain it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly.
