<p>Difficult water use may affect the efficiency of household appliances.

A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits likewise build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence affecting their efficiency.</p>
