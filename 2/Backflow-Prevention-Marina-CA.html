Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is simple and low-cost. However finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often readily available at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
