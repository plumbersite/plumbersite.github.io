If your energy bills are rising, a brand-new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its brand-new location and put there.</p>
