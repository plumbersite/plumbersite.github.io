For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and harden or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place.
