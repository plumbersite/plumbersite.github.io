A traditional tank hot water heater typically lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with appropriate maintenance and care.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 variety.
