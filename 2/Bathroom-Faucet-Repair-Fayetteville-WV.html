<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out below.

The pre-programmed number represents the amount of time in between each regrowth. For example, a lower picked number indicates your softener will regrow less typically.

Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
