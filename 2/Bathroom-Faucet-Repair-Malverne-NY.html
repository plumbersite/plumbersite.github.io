<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Malverne NY</h3>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
