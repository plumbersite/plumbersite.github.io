<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals discovered in water. Normally, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water till it is in your house.
