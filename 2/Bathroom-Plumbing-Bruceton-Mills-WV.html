If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl).

<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad usage for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to make till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and remained in wide usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have actually ended up being increasingly typical, with a variety of products and fittings utilized.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
