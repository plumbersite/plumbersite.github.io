<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its regular circulation. IRWD's drinkable water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "typical," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water getting in the drinkable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
