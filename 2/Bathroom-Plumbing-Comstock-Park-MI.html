<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Comstock Park MI 49321</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
