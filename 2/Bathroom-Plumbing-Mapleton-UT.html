<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and split or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
