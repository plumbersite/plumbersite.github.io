<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch wetness and sediment so that they don't enter the control unit.
