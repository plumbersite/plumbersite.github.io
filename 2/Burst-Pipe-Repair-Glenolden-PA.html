Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>

Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
