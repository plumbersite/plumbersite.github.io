<h3>When To Call A Plumber Linwood NJ</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
