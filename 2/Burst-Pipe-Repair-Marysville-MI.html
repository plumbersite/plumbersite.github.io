The repair of a backflow preventer requires the technician to have the essential understanding of how to detect the issue and restore the backflow prevention assembly to its initial factory specifications. Even if the specialist has the required background, some steps should be taken first before starting the real repair.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
