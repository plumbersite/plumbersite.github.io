<p>Tough water usage might impact the performance of household home appliances. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating procedure and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy.
