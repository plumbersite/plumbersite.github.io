<p>Culpeper House Services offers professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will provide you with options for repair or replacement and recommend the best service depending upon your particular requirements. For double-bowl sinks, the very best method to go about things is to use a continuous waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
