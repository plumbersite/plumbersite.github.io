<p>As soon as a large enough source of water has been identified and assessed, the 3rd major component of a supply of water system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>

<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
