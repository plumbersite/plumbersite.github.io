<p>As holds true with any plumbing home appliance or water treatment system, your water softener should be professionally installed and serviced. This is the only way to make sure that your system can handle the need of your household, and that it will in fact get the job done successfully. Maintenance requirements are very little, but it does pay to have actually the system inspected for proper operation regularly.</p>

Without constant testing and maintenance, these systems can allow polluted water to stream freely within your supply pipes, creating a serious health risk to building residents. Each backflow prevention system needs different testing procedures and periods, and needs considerable experience and knowledge.</p>
