<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Wausau WI</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
