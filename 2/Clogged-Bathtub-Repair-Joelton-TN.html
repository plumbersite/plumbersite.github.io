<p>A recently set up water heater ought to not produce weird noises, however it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify drastically for homes with a high demand for hot water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
