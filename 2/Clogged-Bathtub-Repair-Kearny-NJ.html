<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be performed by a professional plumber if you desire it to work well for years to come. It is a fairly basic device that draws food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are little enough, they pass through to the remainder of the wastewater to be disposed of. If you have a battle drain setup, it typically takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on simply one side.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 various celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, similar to everyone we've come across with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very educated. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either big or small job plumbing work.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
