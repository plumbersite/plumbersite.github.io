<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Leavenworth KS 66048</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
