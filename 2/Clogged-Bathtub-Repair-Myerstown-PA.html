<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Myerstown PA</h3>

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
