<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Sheridan OR</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet repairs and replacements are a natural part of being a property owner. You could sustain much more expensive home damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs.
