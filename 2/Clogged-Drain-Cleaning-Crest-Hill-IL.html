<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to bring in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best method to avoid drain obstructions is to watch what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, discoloration, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are corroding. Rusting pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and should be changed as soon as possible.</p>
