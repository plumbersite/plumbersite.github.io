<p>Before setting up, your professional will switch off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
