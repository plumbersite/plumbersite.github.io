<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has been set up utilizing the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be contacted between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection. The inspectors will arrange their daily work schedules and do not know what inspections have actually been asked for prior to the inspection date.</p>
<p>An authorization is likewise required to reconnect electrical or gas service to a residence. If the utility has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect permits are required. The license cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. A drawing needs to be submitted that identifies the size and length of all piping if you are setting up water or gas piping. Include the Gas Piping Template discovered below with your application.</p>

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a building these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
