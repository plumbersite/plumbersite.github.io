<p>The anode rod in your water heater is designed to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from corroding. The very best way to prevent drain clogs is to watch what you flush.

Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and need to be changed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
