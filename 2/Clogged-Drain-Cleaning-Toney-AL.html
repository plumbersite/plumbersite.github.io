<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
