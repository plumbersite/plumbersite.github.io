<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include appliance wires connected, and others do not. Remove the cover plate underneath the disposal and connect the wires according the manufacturer's guidelines if yours does not. Most standard disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
