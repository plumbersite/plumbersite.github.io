<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
