<p>Wanting to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Lots of clogs are caused by putting excessive toilet tissue into the bowl. Be aware of how much toilet paper your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever place any paper product into the toilet bowl other than toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drainpipe. Feminine hygiene items should be gotten rid of in the trash and never ever in the toilet.</p>
