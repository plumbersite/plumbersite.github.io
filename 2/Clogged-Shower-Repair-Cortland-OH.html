<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
