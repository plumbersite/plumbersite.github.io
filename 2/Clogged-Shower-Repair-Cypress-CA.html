<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean products for each drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly efficient at eliminating gunk, waste, and organic material that so typically congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and just partly fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is a service of live bacteria that actively look for natural material and gnaw at it, creating harmless by-products of carbon water, mineral, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>

<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.

This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
