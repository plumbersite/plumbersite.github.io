<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess.

<p>The normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
