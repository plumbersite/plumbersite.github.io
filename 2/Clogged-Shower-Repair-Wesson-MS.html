<h3>Leak Detection Services in Wesson Mississippi</h2>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that switch on the garbage disposal while running water.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to get rid of grease. Another great technique is using a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
