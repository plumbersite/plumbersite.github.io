The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
