<p>A freshly set up water heater must not produce weird sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things intensify drastically for households with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which ought to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
