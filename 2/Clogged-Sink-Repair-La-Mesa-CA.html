<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
