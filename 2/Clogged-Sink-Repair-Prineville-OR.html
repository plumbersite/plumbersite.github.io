Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
