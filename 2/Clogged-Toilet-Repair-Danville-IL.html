<p>Most homeowners have conventional hot water heater that feature a tank where warm water is kept. While these are affordable initially buy, they are not the most reliable or efficient way for you to get hot water, specifically if your unit is outdated.

Not only do leaking drains cause water damage, they also result in a huge waste of water. A higher-than-normal water bill is frequently an indication that you have a plumbing leak somewhere.</p>
