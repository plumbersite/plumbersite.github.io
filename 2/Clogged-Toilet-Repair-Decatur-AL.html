<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
