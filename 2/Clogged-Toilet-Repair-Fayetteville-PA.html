<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater.

<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly should then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that could result in incorrect information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that could harm parts. The impacts of elevated temperature level can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components.
