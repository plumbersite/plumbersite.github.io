Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
