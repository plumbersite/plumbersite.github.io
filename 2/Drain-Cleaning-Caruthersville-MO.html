<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. , if you plan to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
