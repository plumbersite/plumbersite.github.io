<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
