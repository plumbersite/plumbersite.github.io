<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal growth needs to get away, thus the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and start leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
