<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its typical circulation. IRWD's potable water supply is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "normal," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water entering the potable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently ends up being destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has remained in place given that your house was constructed so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
