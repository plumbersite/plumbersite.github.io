<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Montgomery TX 77356</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
