<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as hospitals and mortuaries, along with commercial facilities.</p>
