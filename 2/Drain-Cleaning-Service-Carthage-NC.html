Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
