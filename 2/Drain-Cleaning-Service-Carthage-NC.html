Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does happen more frequently than you believe! Often it occurs at night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
