<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health hazard if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then each year.</p>
