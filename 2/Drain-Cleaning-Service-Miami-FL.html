Your home is over 10 years old, and you have never ever had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers might get professional discounts from merchants or kitchen and bath display rooms. Compare their expenses with what you can find online or at house improvement stores if you need a new sink or faucet. They might be getting you a better offer</p>
