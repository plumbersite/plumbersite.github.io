Difficult water damages devices, leaves cloudy soap scum across bathrooms and cooking areas, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on tough water for their bathing, cleaning, and cooking, water softeners serve an essential purpose. A water softener saves you from replacing too soon destroyed water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Buying a water softener saves you money, energy, and time, and protects your home and your residential or commercial property.</p>
