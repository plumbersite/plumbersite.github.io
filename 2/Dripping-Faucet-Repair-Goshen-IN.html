It must likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
