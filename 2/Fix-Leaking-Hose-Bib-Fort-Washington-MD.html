In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>In order to prevent your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay attention to what is being cleaned down your system.
