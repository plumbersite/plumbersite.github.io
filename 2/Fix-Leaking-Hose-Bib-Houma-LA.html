<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have cleaned and checked the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the parts to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each element is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the right area. It is also crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the parts or accidentally placed in the body. The parts need to be put so that the guides have the ability to preserve their developed tolerances.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
