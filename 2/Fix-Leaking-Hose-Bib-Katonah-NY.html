<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Katonah NY 10536?</h3>

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.

Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
