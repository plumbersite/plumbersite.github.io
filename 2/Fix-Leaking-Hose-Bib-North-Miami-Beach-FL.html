<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal growth needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to split and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
