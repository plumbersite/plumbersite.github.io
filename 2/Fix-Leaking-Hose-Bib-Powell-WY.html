<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
