<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
