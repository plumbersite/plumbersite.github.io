<p>When you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to connect your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
