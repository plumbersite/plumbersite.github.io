<h3>Drain Unblocking in Columbia City Indiana</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, debris, or hair paper? After years of usage, drains can collect damaging accumulation.

We can achieve this through a variety of techniques such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
