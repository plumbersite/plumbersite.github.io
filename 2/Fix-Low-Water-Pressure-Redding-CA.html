<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Rust can actually consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer.

Water softener systems use resin beads that draw in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
