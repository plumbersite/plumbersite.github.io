<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and re-install locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
