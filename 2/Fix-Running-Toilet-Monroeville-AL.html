<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
