<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public supply of water and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections in between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of defense for the public water system system.</p>

Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will provide an offense notice, and a specific amount of time is allocated to fix the problem.</p>
