However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
