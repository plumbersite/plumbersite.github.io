<p>If you notice an odor or undesirable odor originating from your unit, which is not unusual, think about purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can escape. These flanges are easy and extensively offered to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water supply to your home at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut down the water system to your house. Make sure your water heater's water system is switched off, as is the electrical power going to the system.</p>
