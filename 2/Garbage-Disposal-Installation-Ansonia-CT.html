<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However finding the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are often available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
