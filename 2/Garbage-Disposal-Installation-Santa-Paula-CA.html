<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place.

An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow.
