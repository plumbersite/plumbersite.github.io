Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions.
