<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.

The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
