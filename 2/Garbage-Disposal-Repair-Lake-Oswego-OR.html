<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Lake Oswego</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes broken or clogged, it could wreak unwanted issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
