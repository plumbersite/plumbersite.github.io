<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable option, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
