The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
