You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the exact same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its job pretty well, in time, it still does corrode.

<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will stem from new construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing houses and other structures.
