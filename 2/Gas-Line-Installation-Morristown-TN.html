<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are properly checked by certified workers.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that could cause incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that might damage parts. The impacts of elevated temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the parts. These and other unfavorable effects from the hydraulic conditions must be acknowledged and their cause corrected. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
