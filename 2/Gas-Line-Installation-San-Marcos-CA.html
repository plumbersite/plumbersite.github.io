<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water features are thought about a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on construction strategies.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
