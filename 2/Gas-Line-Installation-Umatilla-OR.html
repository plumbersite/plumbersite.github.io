<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions determined water companies to implement water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Continuous obstructions: If the plunger has become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages suggest your toilet no longer has the power required to effectively remove waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes 3 to 5 days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon home's size and the company doing the work.
