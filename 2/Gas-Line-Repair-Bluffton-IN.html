<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
