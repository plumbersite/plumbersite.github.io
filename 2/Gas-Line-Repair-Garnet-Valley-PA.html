We offer affordable flat-rate costs on all our services. The house still had lead pipes. Homes integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health risks associated with lead.</p>
<p>Whether you're renovating your bathroom or simply updating old components, replacing a toilet can be a big task if you have actually never done it in the past. If you aren't feeling great about completing a toilet installation yourself, or if you uncover any bathroom plumbing problems throughout your remodel, Roto-Rooter plumbers are offered to assist you out.

<p>1. Flashes of cold water - If you're not fuming water, your unit clearly requires repairs. But even if you're sometimes getting bouts of cold water during your hot shower then you must contact our League City water heater repair specialists. What's most likely triggering this is a crack in the tube that is accountable for bringing in cold water into your hot water heater leading to incoming cold water mixing with your outbound hot water.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
