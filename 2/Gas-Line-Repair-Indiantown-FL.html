<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
