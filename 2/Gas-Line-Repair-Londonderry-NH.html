<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Londonderry NH</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
