<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of construction contractors (or their staff members). If you need a waste disposal unit replacement or would like a brand-new disposal set up, you may need the assistance of a professional handyman to ensure the disposal is set up successfully.

Replacing the pipes for many plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure permit.
