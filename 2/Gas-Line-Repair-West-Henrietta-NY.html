<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
