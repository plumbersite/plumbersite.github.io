<p>Difficult water usage might impact the performance of household home appliances. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus affecting their performance.</p>
<p>A well-trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may recommend moving toilets to various restrooms to minimize any future blockages.
