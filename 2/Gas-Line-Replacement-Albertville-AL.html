<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Albertville AL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet repairs and replacements are a natural part of being a property owner. If you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs, you could sustain far more expensive property damage. Even a sluggish leak can damage your subfloors and floorings - resulting in major repairs and even changing the whole floor. An overruning toilet can flood your bathroom, causing unsanitary conditions, wood rot, and mold development.
