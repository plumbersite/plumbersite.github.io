<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can easily catch in this kind of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not provide necessary support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
