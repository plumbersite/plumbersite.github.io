<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
