<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Flemington NJ</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be hard to repair as they are generally located behind the sink, in cramped spaces. The very best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much area and need a broad swing angle, which may be tough to acquire in small areas.</p>
