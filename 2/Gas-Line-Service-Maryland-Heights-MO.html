<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Maryland Heights MO</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
