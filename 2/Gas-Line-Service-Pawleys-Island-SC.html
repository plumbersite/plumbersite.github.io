<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
