<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair.

The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
<p>If your issue is more related to scale and mineral build-up, it is essential to be aware that the majority of scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is caused by hard water.
