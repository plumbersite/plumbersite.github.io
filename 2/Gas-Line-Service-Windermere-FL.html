Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines checked. Some plumbers might get professional discount rates from sellers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can discover online or in your home improvement stores. They might be getting you a much better offer</p>
