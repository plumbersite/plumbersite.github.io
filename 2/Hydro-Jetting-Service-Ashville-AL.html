<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing major and frequent leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need a little different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
