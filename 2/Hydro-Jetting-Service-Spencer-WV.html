Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water.

Appropriate drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
