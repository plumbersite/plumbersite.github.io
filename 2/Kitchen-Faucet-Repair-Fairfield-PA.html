<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Fairfield PA 17320</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
