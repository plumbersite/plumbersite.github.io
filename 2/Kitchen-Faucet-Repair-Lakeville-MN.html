Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
