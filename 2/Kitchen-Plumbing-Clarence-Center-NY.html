<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Clarence Center NY 14032</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
