<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
