<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by securing your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and early failure. Some tough water problems are very noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater elements and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or unnoticeable, these problems have actually real costs associated with them. Clogged components cause replacement or refurbishing costs and can frustrate your consumers. Scale accumulation in your hot water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs. Soon, these small costs can add up to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>
