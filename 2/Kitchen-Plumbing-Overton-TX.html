<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Overton TX 75684</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
