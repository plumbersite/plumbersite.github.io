<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
