A home's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>If you are having extreme issues with your toilet, you might be wondering if it's time to replace the whole thing. There are just a lot of repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right?

<p>We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the difference in between them?

<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically vary from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your home to natural gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line expenses include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
