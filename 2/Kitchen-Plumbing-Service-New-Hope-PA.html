More and more people are trading in their old water heaters for brand-new, tankless versions. Whether you're wanting to increase your home's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of lacking warm water, a tankless water heater could be the perfect option for you.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
