<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>
