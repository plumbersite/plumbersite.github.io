<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined spaces.

<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical models are simpler and cheaper to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
