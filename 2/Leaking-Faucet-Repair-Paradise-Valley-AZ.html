<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Paradise Valley AZ 85253</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
