<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
