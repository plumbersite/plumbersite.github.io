Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
