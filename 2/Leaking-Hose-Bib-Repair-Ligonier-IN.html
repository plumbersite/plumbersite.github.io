<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
