<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I discover that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are stating. Will also state something does not work well simply since they do not like the technology and not since it does not work. If this heater is installed in a home with several restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation costs.</p>
