Handling repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair.

Backflow parts are assembled to make components, and components are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
