The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers need to have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and products.
