<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Forest Hill MD 21050</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
