<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
