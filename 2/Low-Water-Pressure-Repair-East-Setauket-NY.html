<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber East Setauket NY</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
