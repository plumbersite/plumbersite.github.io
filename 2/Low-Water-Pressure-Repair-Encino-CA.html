<h3>Drain Cleaning in Encino CA 91316 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
