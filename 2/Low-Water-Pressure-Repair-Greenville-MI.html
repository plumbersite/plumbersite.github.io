<p>Instead of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter professionals will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it rapidly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the right choice for your home or business.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
