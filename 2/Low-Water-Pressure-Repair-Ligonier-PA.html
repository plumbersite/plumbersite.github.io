<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
