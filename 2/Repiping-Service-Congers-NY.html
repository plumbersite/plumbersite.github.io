<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again important for the repair specialist to be aware of the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to decrease any scale growth or deterioration. It is necessary that the repair service technician is delicate to the hardness and type of the various finishes used on iron body units so as not to harm the protective finishing.</p>

<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently ends up being destructive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that trigger hard water. When water streams through a Water Softener, the system strains these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing. State certified backflow service technicians, readily available through your turf watering company or plumber can determine whether or not your equipment meets the requirements. The policies also require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
