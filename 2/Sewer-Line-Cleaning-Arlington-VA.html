<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
