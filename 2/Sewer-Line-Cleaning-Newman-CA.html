On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include parts or products. Prices depend on the exact repair needed, where you live, working with a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>

If the energy has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 successive months, reconnect authorizations are needed. The authorization cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection costs.
