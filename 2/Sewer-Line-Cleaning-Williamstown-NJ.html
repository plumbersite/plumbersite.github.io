<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at Williamstown NJ 08094</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or long-term connection in between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
