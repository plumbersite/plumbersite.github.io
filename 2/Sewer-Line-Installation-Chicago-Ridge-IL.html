<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Chicago Ridge IL 60415?</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
