<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
