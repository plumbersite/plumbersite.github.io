<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
