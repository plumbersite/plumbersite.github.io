<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>flowing in reverse by obstructing the circulation utilizing drifts or springloaded valves, and (3) vacuum breaker gadgets vent air from pipe to avoid and equalize the pressure siphonage. These devices are often combined into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as check valve assemblies (consisting of 2 successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure concept backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located in between them to dump out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
