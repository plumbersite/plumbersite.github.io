If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater extremely rapidly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Every toilet obstructions every now and then. How frequently a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet blocks more than as soon as a month-or even once a week!- it's most likely due to the fact that mineral deposits have built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
