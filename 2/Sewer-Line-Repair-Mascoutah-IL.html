<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have accomplished a development in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface area Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of temporary hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners regenerate when they notice their softening capability is low as figured out by a pre-programmed number entered by the user. The preset number represents the amount of time in between each regrowth. For example, a lower picked number suggests your softener will regenerate less often.

Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
