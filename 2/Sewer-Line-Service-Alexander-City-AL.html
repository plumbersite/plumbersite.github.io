<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three various celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, just like each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and extremely well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
