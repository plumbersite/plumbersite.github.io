<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Round front toilets are compact to fit in little areas and are more economical than elongated bowl designs. Extended toilets include extended rim length, especially developed for comfy usage by adults.
