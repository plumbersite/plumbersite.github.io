Please note that Virginia's Building regulations prohibits the use of any plumbing components or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is advantageous to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need assistance scheduling an inspection. Structure, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Defense work need additional licenses and inspections. Different notices are available to explain the inspections needed for each type of permit.</p>
