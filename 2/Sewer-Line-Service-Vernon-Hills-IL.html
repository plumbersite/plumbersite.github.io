<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

<p>The usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.
