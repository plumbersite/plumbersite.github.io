Sometimes conditions on homes change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your business, they can trigger financial losses and in some instances can stop your company totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little office the concerns triggered by even little drain problems can trigger major concerns.</p>

Turn off the water at the valves under the sink, and turn on the faucet to allow the water to drain. Make sure the drains are plugged to avoid small parts from falling in.</p>
