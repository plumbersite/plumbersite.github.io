Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
