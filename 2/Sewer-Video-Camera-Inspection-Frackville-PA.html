<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

From under the sink, slide the fiber gasket, backup flange and installing flange over the sink flange. Hold these pieces in location.

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
