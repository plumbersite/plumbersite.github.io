<p>Every toilet clogs once in awhile. How often a toilet obstructions depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet obstructs more than as soon as a month-or even once a week!- it's most likely since mineral deposits have built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
