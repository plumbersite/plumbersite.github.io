<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
