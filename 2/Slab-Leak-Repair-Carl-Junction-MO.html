However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
