<p>If you have a large bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms, this style water heater may make the most sense for you. There are some installation considerations, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to develop more hot water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are quite unique. High-efficiency storage is a terrific alternative for area heating hydronic choices too.</p>
