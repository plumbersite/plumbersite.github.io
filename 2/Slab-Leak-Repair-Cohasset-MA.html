<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
