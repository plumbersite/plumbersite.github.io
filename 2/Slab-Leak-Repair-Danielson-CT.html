<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work.

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
