<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Improved efficiency likewise suggests that you'll take pleasure in a reduction in your energy costs, as your devices will not need to work more difficult or use more water in order to operate at their best.</p>
