<h3>Clogged Drain Services at King City CA 93930</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are considered a health hazard. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Your expenses likewise will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and linking the brand-new one. Many plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that emerge will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might affect the time it takes. Because carbon monoxide gets released into the air while burning natural gas, these types of heaters can result in a considerable quantity of pollution.</p>
