The best way to prevent drain obstructions is to enjoy what you flush. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, discoloration, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Rusting pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and should be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
