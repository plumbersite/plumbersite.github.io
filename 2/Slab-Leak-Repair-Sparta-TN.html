<p>The majority of house owners have conventional water heaters that include a tank where hot water is saved. While these are cost-efficient in the beginning buy, they are not the most reliable or effective method for you to get warm water, especially if your system is outdated. If your hot water heater is more than 8 years of ages, it might be time to consider changing it with a new energy-efficient design. That's where the plumbers at Casteel comes in.</p>

<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.
