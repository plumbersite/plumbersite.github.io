When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with big accumulations of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also collect to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence affecting their performance.</p>
