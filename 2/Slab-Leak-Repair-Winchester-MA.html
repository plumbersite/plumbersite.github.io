<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
