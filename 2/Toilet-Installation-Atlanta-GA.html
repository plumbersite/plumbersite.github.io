We rank 3rd for the outright worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In truth the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is ideal for pool. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond national health standards, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "very hard water".</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
