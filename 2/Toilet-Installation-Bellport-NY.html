When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
