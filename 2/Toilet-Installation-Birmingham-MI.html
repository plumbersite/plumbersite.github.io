<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most common issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is specifically true if you have untreated hard water, which consists of harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages often mean a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
