You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your home, repiping might take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your everyday routine. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and then eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible intact.</p>
