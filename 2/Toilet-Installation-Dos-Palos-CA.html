<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
