<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention alternatives, however they also offer the least quantity of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are correctly tested by certified personnel.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house. Normally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
