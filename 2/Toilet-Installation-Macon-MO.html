Tough water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward.

<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Macon MO</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may look like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners may be an inexpensive option, the harsh active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, over time, producing weak points in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system.
