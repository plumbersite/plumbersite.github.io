This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
