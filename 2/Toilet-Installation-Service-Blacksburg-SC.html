<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Blacksburg SC 29702</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
