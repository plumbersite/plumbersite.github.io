<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Jenison Michigan</h2>

Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair specialist-- from fast repairs to structural repair, we do it all.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Jenison MI 49428</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
