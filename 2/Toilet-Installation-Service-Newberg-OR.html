<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from deterioration and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house.
