Typically, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it remains in your house.

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.
