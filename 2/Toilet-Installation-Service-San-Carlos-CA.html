Difficult water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility costs will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your home is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
