We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs require the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Lots of parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the right place. It is also essential that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or accidentally placed in the body. The elements must be put so that the guides are able to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>

When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
