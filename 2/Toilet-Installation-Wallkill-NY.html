<p>Cold showers? High energy expenses? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed properly.

That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
