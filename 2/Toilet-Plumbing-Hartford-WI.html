<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as described below. Both will create a great seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Dealing with a leaky faucet or sputtery garbage disposal is never ever fun, however postponing repairing it for too long can cause water damage or increase your water costs.

Get an estimate on just how much you'll invest to fix your kitchen or bathroom sink with this guide.</p>
