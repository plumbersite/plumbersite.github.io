Also verify that workers' compensation and liability insurance plan are active.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
