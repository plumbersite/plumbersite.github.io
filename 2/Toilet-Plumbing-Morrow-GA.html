<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house.

I just recently had to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was only 6 years old. Traditional hot water heater with a tank need to generally last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than two years. Washing meals is my least favorite task, specifically without the aid of a dishwasher.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Morrow GA 30260</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
