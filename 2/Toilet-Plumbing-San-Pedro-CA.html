<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at San Pedro CA 90731</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day.
