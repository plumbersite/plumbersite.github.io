For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
