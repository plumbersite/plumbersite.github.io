<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
