<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Galax VA</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
