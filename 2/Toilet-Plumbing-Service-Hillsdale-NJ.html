<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
