<p>This article intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of complicated realities that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must likewise be corrosive, best? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
