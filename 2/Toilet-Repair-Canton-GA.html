For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the safe and clean water system. To secure water quality, backflow protection is required where the end user presents a risk of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>
