Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a constant feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can create noise. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down.

Water softener systems use resin beads that connect and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
