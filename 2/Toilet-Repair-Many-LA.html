The preset number represents the amount of time between each regeneration. For example, a lower picked number indicates your softener will regrow less often.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air.

This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
