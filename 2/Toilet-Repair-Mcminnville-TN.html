Generally, minerals arrive since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as successfully removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>

When you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your home, then that typically implies that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in multiple places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup.
