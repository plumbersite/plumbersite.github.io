<p>You can also depend on water softeners to decrease your day-to-day operating costs by conserving detergent and enabling you to use lower water temperature levels while keeping a high-quality wash. Water firmness, determined by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs throughout the U.S. from slightly difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating element, there is a good chance your pilot burner has headed out.
