<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are customized to your particular issue. Whether the clog is in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. The area of the drain is necessary due to the fact that it helps our plumbers to know the type of clog they may be dealing with. Shower drains typically get hair obstructions, and kitchen sink drains are vulnerable to grease obstructions.</p>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be treated quickly if the clog is shallow and simple. For most clogs you'll just need a plunger, and often some chemicals, however if this does not solve the problem then you might also need to call in a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
