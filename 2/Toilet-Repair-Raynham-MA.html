<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Raynham MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
