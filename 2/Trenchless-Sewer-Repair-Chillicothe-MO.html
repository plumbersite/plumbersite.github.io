Leave the premises instantly then call 911 and Atmos Energy at 866-322-8667. Do not depend on your sense of odor alone to detect the existence of gas.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
