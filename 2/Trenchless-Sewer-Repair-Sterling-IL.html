It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>

This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

Insects and rats can easily squeeze through cracks and spaces in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These insects can be very harmful to your health.
