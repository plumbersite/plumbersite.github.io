<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Studio City CA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the support of a professional. Some minor blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and often, when the toilet won't stop running, it's an easy matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, certain issues do require an experienced plumber, and it is essential to understand the distinction to prevent squandered frustration, money, and time.</p>
