<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Walkertown NC</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their tasks break out into two classifications: Plumbers who manage standard repairs (typically in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling tasks and additions.</p>
