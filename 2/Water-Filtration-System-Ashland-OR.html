<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to represent the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure.

The remedy for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
