<h3>Clogged Toilet in Red Lion Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Hot water heater can be an expensive financial investment for house owners that they live with for over a years. That's why when it's time to equip your new home or replace your old hot water heater, it is very important to consider the cost, performance, and longevity of a new unit. Plumbers usually charge $45 to $65 an hour and can generally install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't always suggest they need to be changed. Well-maintained pipes may last longer, and poorly kept ones or those in areas with tough water (meaning it has high mineral material), might stop working sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
