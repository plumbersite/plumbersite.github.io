For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and crack or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place.
