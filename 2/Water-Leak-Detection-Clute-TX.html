<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Clute TX</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden pipes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>
