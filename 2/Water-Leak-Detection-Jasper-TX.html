<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities.
