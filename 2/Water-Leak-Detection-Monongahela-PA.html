It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
