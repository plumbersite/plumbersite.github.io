<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
