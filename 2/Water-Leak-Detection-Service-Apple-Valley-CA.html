<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.
