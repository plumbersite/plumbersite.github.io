However are you aware just how bad? The majority of the Valley in reality has a few of the worst water in the nation.

In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is perfect for pool. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond nationwide health standards, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the national average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness factors "really tough water".</p>

<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergencies that we run into in the houses around the Bay Area. The initial problems that happen are the staining of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that might have a nasty odor.

The broad disparity in price is due to the size of the house, the type of pipe you're setting up, and additional repairs you discover you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
