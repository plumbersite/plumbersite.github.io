Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. Then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your home. This can happen in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
