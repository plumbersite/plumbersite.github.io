Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, together with flexible rubber traps. Debris can easily capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not provide needed assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>

Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
