<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
