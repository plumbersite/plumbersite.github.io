<p>Wanting to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Many blockages are caused by putting excessive toilet tissue into the bowl. Be aware of just how much toilet tissue your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever put any paper product into the toilet bowl besides bathroom tissue. Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drainpipe. Womanly health items should be disposed of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>

<p>Dealing with a leaky faucet or sputtery waste disposal unit is never fun, but postponing repairing it for too long can cause water damage or increase your water costs. Working with a contractor to repair an issue with your sink or faucet as quickly as it starts deserves the cost - particularly when your DIY clogged-drain repairs and bolt-tightening efforts no longer work.
