<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes East Greenbush NY</h3>

If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
