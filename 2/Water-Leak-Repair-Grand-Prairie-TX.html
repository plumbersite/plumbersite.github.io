<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
