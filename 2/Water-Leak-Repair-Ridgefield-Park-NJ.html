Their energy efficiency is higher than a tank, however the flow of hot water is restricted to about 3.5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
