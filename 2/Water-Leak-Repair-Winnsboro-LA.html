<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are needed to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law also requires backflow assemblies in commercial establishments such as medical facilities and mortuaries, in addition to commercial facilities.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
