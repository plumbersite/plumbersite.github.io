<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Galion OH 44833</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
