<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>
