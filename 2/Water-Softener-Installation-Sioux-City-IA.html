<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
