<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Valley Village CA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that backflow prevention is required when needed, together with inspection of the device to make certain it's working correctly. In The House Service Doctors, our Sewerologists have years of sewer repair and replacement experience under our belts.
