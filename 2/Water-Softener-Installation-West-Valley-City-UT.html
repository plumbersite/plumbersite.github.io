<p>Your house's drains and pipes quietly eliminate thousands of gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even giving them a doubt. Nevertheless, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene products, toys, and other foreign objects make their way into your drains, they can result in severe problems.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
