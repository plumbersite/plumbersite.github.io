Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
