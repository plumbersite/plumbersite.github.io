For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and break or just be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape.</p>
