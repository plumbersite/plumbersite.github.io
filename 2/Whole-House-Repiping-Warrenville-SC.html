<p>Homeowners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is particularly prudent to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new house. Tank hot water heater are normally the least pricey systems. Nevertheless, all storage water heaters lose some amount of heat over time due to the fact that they should continuously keep water in the tank hot. Despite this standby heat loss, storage water heaters have come a long way in terms of efficiency; choosing the most efficient system you can afford will help you recoup higher energy savings gradually. Tankless water heaters cost more to purchase and install than storage systems but save cash on both energy and water by eliminating standby heat loss and heating water much faster so less cold water is lost while you wait.</p>
